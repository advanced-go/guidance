Data consistency.

Does this need to support rollback and auditing?? - Auditing only, rollback is over kill.
Refresh on a fixed predetermined schedule.
Maybe use change data capture??

A. Global Scheduling
  - There needs to be a fixed schedule to query for new data.

  - This schedule can be fixed for this type of data as the refresh interval can be communicated to a user.
    Maybe hourly?

  - There should be an agent that can update the package cache of schedules.


B. Dimensional Scheduling - via Groups
   1. By Groups
      - This runs into a cardinality issue with many hosts and changes to those hosts?
      - Maybe a small number of schedules can be kept and reduce the cardinality
      - Support multiple schedules for a given option.
         a. So for dependency checking, let there be several groups that a given host can pick from
      - These can then be refreshed similar to global schedules.
   2. By Dimension
      - Not supported
