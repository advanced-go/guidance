This is dimensional data, stored by dimension.
The cardinality and change frequency of this data does not allow a common package to manage consistency.

Therefore, this data must reside in memory with the agent that needs this data.

So, agents need to be sharded by the origin, so that a given controller update can be routed to the appropriate
shard/host.

Maybe also a ring buffer architecture.
