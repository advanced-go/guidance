This is dimensional data, stored by dimension.
The cardinality and change frequency of this data does not allow a common package to manage consistency.

Therefore, this data must reside in memory with the agent that needs this data.

So, agents need to be sharded by the origin, so that a given controller update can be routed to the appropriate
shard/host.

Maybe also a ring buffer architecture.


2. Controller
   - A host entry must be created by a user, no changeset needed as there is no rollback. At that time
   - At that time, the options for dependency management and processing will be created.
   - The initial version number is 0.0.0
   - Updating of the entry can be done via a post command
