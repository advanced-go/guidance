Cost policy is used to control routing decisions.

Routing decisions arise in 2 use cases:
 1. Application startup.
    a. Authority routing
       - Find an origin based on authority. Is there a preference for authority, like a primary/secondary
       - Is there a cost policy to determine origin scope?
       - What are the metrics to determine origin scope? Latency, Consistency, Availability
       - What conditions would cause a change in how metrics are valued? Choosing availability over latency?
       - What is the default when there are no metrics??

    b. Host routing
       - Find a host, same host name in different origins.
       - Same issues as above relating to cost and metrics
