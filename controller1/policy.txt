A controller policy needs the following:
 1. Some way to create a complete URL given an incoming request
    a. If the request contains a authority, then it should b automatic

 2. Timeout - optional as this defaults to 3 seconds

 3. RateLimiting - only disabling is allowed as rate limiting is enabled by default with the
                   rate limit and rate burst configured dynamically. The threshold to start
                   rate limiting is also determined dynamically based on experience
 4. Policy - controls how a host is selected
    a. Need the ability to limit possible hosts
       - Limit by Region, Zone, SubZone, Host


B. When authority URL's are used.
   1. Ingress controllers
      a. Need a list of ingress authorities to publish.
         - One timeout override for ingress host controller
   2. Egress controllers
      a. Need a list of egress authorities
         - Route Name
         - Optional timeout
         - Optional disabling RateLimiting - rate limiting is good for transient latencies
         - Limit egress origins by Region, Zone, SubZone, Host
         - Need an optional timespan so that the origins can be tested during off hours.
           Can this be configured dynamically??


C. How to remove an authority?
   1. Suddenly disappears, egress controller needs to react.
   2. Permanently, need to be guidance set by a user

D. How to handle versioning??
